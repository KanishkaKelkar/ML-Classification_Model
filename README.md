# Abalone Clustering

# About Data:-
Abalone is a large marine gastropod mollusk.
For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle performed EDA & data preprocessing, built a Classification model to find the accuracy. This model is built to predict whether the target is predicted correctly based on other feature description.

# Feature description:-
1) Sex- Abalones are dioecious (separate male and female sex)
2) Next features contains its height, diameter and length
3) Then it has different weight feature like Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight.
4) Ring feature give is ring width of the abalone.
   


# Procedure:-
1) Import library
2) Load dataset
3) EDA & Preprocessing : descriptive statistics, pairplot, visualisation, corelation
4) Model Creation : divide into x & y, train test spilt, models are KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
5) Hyperparameter Tunning 
6) Cross Validation
